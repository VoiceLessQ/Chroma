# Block Properties Configuration File
#
# This file controls how blocks are rendered in the shader pack by:
# 1. Mapping block IDs to specific rendering behaviors
# 2. Defining render layers for different transparency types
# 3. Assigning special rendering properties to specific blocks
#
# Format:
# - block.<id>=<block1> <block2> ... (maps substitute block IDs)
# - layer.<layer>=<blocks> (defines which blocks use which render layer)
#===============================================================================

#===============================================
# BLOCK ID MAPPING
#===============================================
# Maps substitute block IDs to actual block names for custom rendering
# Format: block.<id>=<block1> <block2> <block3> ...
# This allows you to create custom rendering for groups of similar blocks

# Basic building blocks for testing and development
block.1000=stone dirt grass_block      # Common terrain blocks
block.1001=oak_log oak_leaves birch_log # Wood and leaf blocks
block.1002=water ice glass             # Transparent blocks

# Special effect blocks with unique rendering properties
block.2000=redstone_torch redstone_wall_torch  # Light-emitting redstone components
block.2001=glowstone sea_lantern shroomlight   # Bright light sources
block.2002=chest trapped_chest                 # Storage containers with tile entities
block.2003=banner wall_banner                  # Textile blocks with patterns
block.2004=sign hanging_sign                   # Text display blocks

# Block entity specific rendering (tile entities)
block.3000=minecraft:chest minecraft:trapped_chest      # Chest-like containers
block.3001=minecraft:sign minecraft:hanging_sign       # Text displays
block.3002=minecraft:banner minecraft:wall_banner      # Patterned banners
block.3003=minecraft:beacon minecraft:conduit          # Special effect blocks

# RENDER LAYER DEFINITIONS
#===============================================
# Defines which blocks render on which transparency layer
# Each layer has different rendering characteristics:
# - Solid: No alpha, no blending (fastest)
# - Cutout: Alpha testing, no blending (medium performance)
# - Translucent: Alpha blending, mipmaps (slowest but most accurate)

# SOLID LAYER - No alpha, no blending
# For completely opaque blocks that don't need transparency
# Performance: Fastest rendering
layer.solid=stone dirt grass_block sand gravel          # Basic terrain
layer.solid=oak_log birch_log spruce_log jungle_log acacia_log dark_oak_log  # Wood logs
layer.solid=cobblestone stone_bricks nether_bricks   # Building materials
layer.solid=iron_block gold_block diamond_block emerald_block  # Ores and minerals

# CUTOUT LAYER - Alpha testing, no blending, mipmaps
# For blocks with cutout transparency (holes in texture)
# Uses alpha test to discard transparent pixels below threshold
# Performance: Medium (faster than translucent)
layer.cutout=oak_leaves birch_leaves spruce_leaves jungle_leaves acacia_leaves dark_oak_leaves  # Tree leaves
layer.cutout=grass_block fern large_fern              # Plant textures with holes
layer.cutout=vine sweet_berries                      # Vine and berry textures
layer.cutout=glass stained_glass glass_pane stained_glass_pane  # Glass blocks with transparency

# TRANSLUCENT LAYER - Alpha blending, mipmaps
# For blocks with transparency that need blending
# Uses alpha blending for smooth transparency effects
# Performance: Slowest (requires depth sorting)
layer.translucent=water ice lava                      # Liquid blocks
layer.translucent=stained_glass stained_glass_pane   # Colored glass
layer.translucent=beacon_construction beacon_glass   # Beacon effects
layer.translucent=slime_block honey_block             # Gel-like blocks
